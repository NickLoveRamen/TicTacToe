# TicTacToe

A basic TicTacToe game inside the terminal

## Usage

`npm start`

## Config

Edit the constants in `/src/TTT_field.js`

`ROWS` for number of rows,

`COLS` for number of columns,

`WIN` for win condition,

 _A win condition of 3 means that three of the same symbol must be in a row either verically, horizontally, or diagonally to trigger a win. You can make this any number, but know that certain values will create an unwinnable game (values < 0, values > the largest dimension of the field)_

`X` for player 1 symbol,

`O` for player 2 symbol

 _Symbols can be any ascii character_
